 * Because of a limitation in libbabeltrace, i.e. two BT iterators
 * cannot exist concurrently in a single BT context, a trace set
 * iterator doesn't own its BT iterator. This means:
 *
 *   * the internal BT iterator won't be destroyed in the trace
 *     set iterator's destructor
 *   * copying a trace set iterator is okay, but all iterators obtained
 *     from a given trace set will always be synchronized (moved
 *     together)
